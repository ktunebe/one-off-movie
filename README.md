# social-network-api

## Description

This is a project for UW in which we were asked to create the back end for a social network API using express, MongoDB and the Mongoose npm. Users can be added with a username and email address. Users can create and post thoughts, as well as post reactions to other users' thoughts. Users can also add or remove other users to and from their friends list. User and thought info can be updated or deleted, and when a user is deleted, all of their thoughts are deleted and they are removed from other users' friends lists.

## Installation

This app uses MongoDB to store and interact with the database.

Pull the contents of this repo into a local directory. Navigate to the directory and type `npm install` into the command line to install npm packages. 

## Usage
